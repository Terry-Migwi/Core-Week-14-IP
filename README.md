## Project Description
1. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques with R.

The aim of this project is to reduce the dimensionality of the data provided to allow for great visualization of the datapoints. The project entails Exploratory Data Analysis on the variables, visualizing the variables to get a better understanding of the dataset and application of two dimensionality reduction techniques i.e Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T - Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (T-SNE).

2. Feature Selection in Unsupervised Learning with R

The aim of the project is to select important features from the dataset provided to assist in creating an accurate predictive model. The project makes use of three techniques of feature selection in unsupervised learning i.e Filter Methods, Wrapper Methods and Feature Ranking.
The steps followed include loading and checking the dataset, pre-processing the dataset, performing Exploratory Data analysis on the data and finally applying the feature selection methods mentioned above.

3. Association Analysis with R

The aim of the project is to identify relationships between items in the dataset given. The steps followed include: loading the dataset as transactions, checking and visualizing the most frequently bought items in the dataset, performing association analysis and visualizations to help better understand the rules generated and finally giving recommendations on how to place items in the stores to help promote the sale of a particular item.

3. Anomaly Detection with R

The aim of the study is to detect and visualize anomalies from a time series dataset.
